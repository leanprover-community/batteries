Lean checks that `proof_wanted` declarations are well-formed (e.g. it ensures that all the\nmentioned names are in scope, and that the theorem statement is a valid proposition), but they are\ndiscarded afterwards. This means that they cannot be used as axioms.\n\nTypical usage:\n```\n@[simp] proof_wanted empty_find?
