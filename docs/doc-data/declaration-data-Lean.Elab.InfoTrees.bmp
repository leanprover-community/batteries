Otherwise, these filters are processed in\nleft-to-right order, with an implicit `pass all` at the end.\n\nWhitespace handling (after trimming leading and trailing whitespace):\n- `whitespace := exact` requires an exact whitespace match.\n- `whitespace := normalized` converts all newline characters to a space before matching\n  (the default). This allows breaking long lines.\n- `whitespace := lax` collapses whitespace to a single space before matching.\n\nMessage ordering:\n- `ordering := exact` uses the exact ordering of the messages (the default).\n- `ordering := sorted` sorts the messages in lexicographic order.\n  This helps with testing commands that are non-deterministic in their ordering.\n\nPosition reporting:\n- `positions := true` reports the ranges of all messages relative to the line on which\n  `#guard_msgs` appears.\n- `positions := false` does not report position info.\n\nSubstring matching:\n- `substring := true` checks that the docstring appears as a substring of the output\n  (after whitespace normalization). This is useful when you only care about part of the message.\n- `substring := false` (the default) requires exact matching (modulo whitespace normalization).\n\nStabilizing output:\nWhen messages contain autogenerated names (e.g., metavariables like `?m.47`), the output may\ndiffer between runs or Lean versions. Use `set_option pp.mvars.anonymous false` to replace\nanonymous metavariables with `?_` while preserving user-named metavariables like `?a`.\nAlternatively, `set_option pp.mvars false` replaces all metavariables with `?_`.\n\nFor example, `#guard_msgs (error, drop all) in cmd` means to check errors and drop\neverything else.\n\nThe command elaborator has special support for `#guard_msgs` for linting.\nThe `#guard_msgs` itself wants to capture linter warnings,\nso it elaborates the command it is attached to as if it were a top-level command.\nHowever, the command elaborator runs linters for *all* top-level commands,\nwhich would include `#guard_msgs` itself, and would cause duplicate and/or uncaptured linter warnings.\nThe top-level command elaborator only runs the linters if `#guard_msgs` is not present.\n","docLink":"./Lean/Elab/InfoTrees.html#Lean.Elab.Tactic.InfoTrees.elabInfoTrees","kind":"def","line":17,"name":"Lean.Elab.Tactic.InfoTrees.elabInfoTrees","sourceLink":"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/985f350dcd18fc7814dfa677cac09933f44f3215/src/Lean/Elab/InfoTrees.lean#L17-L27"}}],"imports":["Lean.Elab.Command"],"instances":[],"name":"Lean.Elab.InfoTrees"}
