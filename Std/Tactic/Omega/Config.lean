  Split disjunctions in the context.

  Note that with `splitDisjunctions := false` omega will not be able to solve `x = y` goals
  as these are usually handled by introducing `¬ x = y` as a hypothesis, then replacing this with
  `x < y ∨ x > y`.

  On the other hand, `omega` does not currently detect disjunctions which, when split,
  introduce no new useful information, so the presence of irrelevant disjunctions in the context
  can significantly increase run time.

  `b ≤ a ∧ ((a - b : Nat) : Int) = a - b ∨ a < b ∧ ((a - b : Nat) : Int) = 0`
  for later splitting.
