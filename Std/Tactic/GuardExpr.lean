The various `guard_*` tactics have similar matching specifiers for how equal expressions
have to be to pass the tactic.
This inductive gives the different specifiers that can be selected.

/-- A syntactic match means that the `Expr`s are `==` after stripping `MData` -/

/-- A defeq match `isDefEqGuarded` returns true. (Note that unification is allowed here.) -/

Tactic to check equality of two expressions.
* `guard_expr e = e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are defeq at reducible transparency.
* `guard_expr e =~ e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are defeq at default transparency.
* `guard_expr e =ₛ e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are syntactically equal.
* `guard_expr e =ₐ e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are alpha-equivalent.

Both `e` and `e'` are elaborated then have their metavariables instantiated before the equality
check. Their types are unified (using `isDefEqGuarded`) before synthetic metavariables are
processed, which helps with default instance handling.

Tactic to check that the target agrees with a given expression.
* `guard_target = e` checks that the target is defeq at reducible transparency to `e`.
* `guard_target =~ e` checks that the target is defeq at default transparency to `e`.
* `guard_target =ₛ e` checks that the target is syntactically equal to `e`.
* `guard_target =ₐ e` checks that the target is alpha-equivalent to `e`.

The term `e` is elaborated with the type of the goal as the expected type, which is mostly
useful within `conv` mode.

Tactic to check that a named hypothesis has a given type and/or value.

* `guard_hyp h : t` checks the type up to reducible defeq,
* `guard_hyp h :~ t` checks the type up to default defeq,
* `guard_hyp h :ₛ t` checks the type up to syntactic equality,
* `guard_hyp h :ₐ t` checks the type up to alpha equality.
* `guard_hyp h := v` checks value up to reducible defeq,
* `guard_hyp h :=~ v` checks value up to default defeq,
* `guard_hyp h :=ₛ v` checks value up to syntactic equality,
* `guard_hyp h :=ₐ v` checks the value up to alpha equality.

The value `v` is elaborated using the type of `h` as the expected type.

Command to check that an expression evaluates to `true`.

`#guard e` elaborates `e` ensuring its type is `Bool` then evaluates `e` and checks that
the result is `true`. The term is elaborated *without* variables declared using `variable`, since
these cannot be evaluated.

Since this makes use of coercions, so long as a proposition `p` is decidable, one can write
`#guard p` rather than `#guard decide p`. A consequence to this is that if there is decidable
equality one can write `#guard a = b`. Note that this is not exactly the same as checking
if `a` and `b` evaluate to the same thing since it uses the `DecidableEq` instance to do
the evaluation.

Note: this uses the untrusted evaluator, so `#guard` passing is *not* a proof that the
expression equals `true`. -/
