/--
Check if a goal is "independent" of a list of other goals.
We say a goal is independent of other goals if assigning a value to it
can not change the assignability of the other goals.

Examples:
* `?m_1 : Type` is not independent of `?m_2 : ?m_1`,
  because we could assign `true : Bool` to `?m_2`,
  but if we first assign `Nat` to `?m_1` then that is no longer possible.
* `?m_1 : Nat` is not independent of `?m_2 : Fin ?m_1`,
  because we could assign `37 : Fin 42` to `?m_2`,
  but if we first assign `2` to `?m_1` then that is no longer possible.
* `?m_1 : ?m_2` is not independent of `?m_2 : Type`, because we could assign `Bool` to ?m_2`,
  but if we first assign `0 : Nat` to `?m_1` then that is no longer possible.
* Given `P : Prop` and `f : P → Type`, `?m_1 : P` is independent of `?m_2 : f ?m_1`
  by proof irrelevance.
* Similarly given `f : Fin 0 → Type`, `?m_1 : Fin 0` is independent of `?m_2 : f ?m_1`,
  because `Fin 0` is a subsingleton.
* Finally `?m_1 : Nat` is independent of `?m_2 : α`,
  as long as `?m_1` does not appear in `Meta.getMVars α`
  (note that `Meta.getMVars` follows delayed assignments).

This function only calculates a conservative approximation of this condition.
That is, it may return `false` when it should return `true`.
(In particular it returns false whenever the type of `g` contains a metavariable,
regardless of whether this is related to the metavariables in `L`.)

all the remaining goals (i.e. those on which `f` failed).

`saturate1 goal tac` runs `tac` on `goal`, then on the resulting goals, etc.,
until `tac` does not apply to any goal any more (i.e. it returns `none`). The
order of applications is depth-first, so if `tac` generates goals `[g₁, g₂, ⋯]`,
we apply `tac` to `g₁` and recursively to all its subgoals before visiting `g₂`.
If `tac` does not apply to `goal`, `saturate1` returns `none`. Otherwise it
returns the generated subgoals to which `tac` did not apply. `saturate1`
respects the `MonadRecDepth` recursion limit.
