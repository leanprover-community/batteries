# Extensions to the `case` tactic

Adds a variant of `case` that looks for a goal with a particular type, rather than a goal
with a particular tag.
For consistency with `case`, it takes a tag as well, but the tag can be a hole `_`.

Also adds `case'` extensions.

* `case _ : t => tac` finds the first goal that unifies with `t` and then solves it
  using `tac` or else fails. Like `show`, it changes the type of the goal to `t`.
  The `_` can optionally be a case tag, in which case it only looks at goals
  whose tag would be considered by `case` (goals with an exact tag match,
  followed by goals with the tag as a suffix, followed by goals with the tag as a prefix).

* `case _ n₁ ... nₘ : t => tac` additionally names the `m` most recent hypotheses with
  inaccessible names to the given names. The names are renamed before matching against `t`.
  The `_` can optionally be a case tag.

* `case _ : t := e` is short for `case _ : t => exact e`.

* `case _ : t₁ | _ : t₂ | ... => tac`
  is equivalent to `(case _ : t₁ => tac); (case _ : t₂ => tac); ...`
  but with all matching done on the original list of goals --
  each goal is consumed as they are matched, so patterns may repeat or overlap.

* `case _ : t` will make the matched goal be the first goal.
  `case _ : t₁ | _ : t₂ | ...` makes the matched goals be the first goals in the given order.

* `case _ : t := _` and `case _ : t := ?m` are the same as `case _ : t` but in the `?m` case the
  goal tag is changed to `m`.
  In particular, the goal becomes metavariable `?m`.

/-- `case' _ : t => tac` is similar to the `case _ : t => tac` tactic,
but it does not ensure the goal has been solved after applying `tac`,

Recall that `case` closes the goal using `sorry` when `tac` fails,
and the tactic execution is not interrupted. -/
