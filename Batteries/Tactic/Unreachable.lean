/--
This tactic causes a panic when run (at compile time).
(This is distinct from `exact unreachable!`, which inserts code which will panic at run time.)

It is intended for tests to assert that a tactic will never be executed, which is otherwise an
unusual thing to do (and the `unreachableTactic` linter will give a warning if you do).

The `unreachableTactic` linter has a special exception for uses of `unreachable!`.
```
example : True := by trivial <;> unreachable!
```
-/
elab (name := unreachable) "unreachable!" : tactic => do
  panic! "unreachable tactic has been reached"
  -- Note that `panic!` does not actually halt execution or early exit,
  -- so we still have to throw an error after panicking.
  throwError "unreachable tactic has been reached"

@[inherit_doc unreachable] macro (name := unreachableConv) "unreachable!" : conv =>
  `(conv| tactic' => unreachable!)
