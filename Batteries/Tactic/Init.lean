`_` in tactic position acts like the `done` tactic: it fails and gives the list
of goals if there are any. It is useful as a placeholder after starting a tactic block
such as `by _` to make it syntactically correct and show the current goal.
-/
macro "_" : tactic => `(tactic| {})

/--
Like `exact`, but takes a list of terms and checks that all goals are discharged after the tactic.

elab (name := exacts) "exacts " "[" hs:term,* "]" : tactic => do
  for stx in hs.getElems do
    evalTactic (← `(tactic| exact $stx))
  evalTactic (← `(tactic| done))

/--
`by_contra h` proves `⊢ p` by contradiction,
introducing a hypothesis `h : ¬p` and proving `False`.
* If `p` is a negation `¬q`, `h : q` will be introduced instead of `¬¬q`.
* If `p` is decidable, it uses `Decidable.byContradiction` instead of `Classical.byContradiction`.
* If `h` is omitted, the introduced variable `_: ¬p` will be anonymous.

Given a proof `h` of `p`, `absurd h` changes the goal to `⊢ ¬ p`.
If `p` is a negation `¬q` then the goal is changed to `⊢ q` instead.

`fapply e` is like `apply e` but it adds goals in the order they appear,
rather than putting the dependent goals first.
-/
elab "fapply " e:term : tactic =>
  evalApplyLikeTactic (·.apply (cfg := {newGoals := .all})) e

/--
`eapply e` is like `apply e` but it does not add subgoals for variables that appear
in the types of other goals. Note that this can lead to a failure where there are
no goals remaining but there are still metavariables in the term:
```
example (h : ∀ x : Nat, x = x → True) : True := by
  eapply h
  rfl
  -- no goals
-- (kernel) declaration has metavariables '_example'
```

elab "eapply " e:term : tactic =>

/-- `conv` tactic to close a goal using an equality theorem. -/
macro (name := Conv.exact) "exact " t:term : conv => `(conv| tactic => exact $t)

/-- The `conv` tactic `equals` claims that the currently focused subexpression is equal
 to the given expression, and proves this claim using the given tactic.
```
example (P : (Nat → Nat) → Prop) : P (fun n => n - n) := by
  conv in (_ - _) => equals 0 =>
    -- current goal: ⊢ n - n = 0
    apply Nat.sub_self
  -- current goal: P (fun n => 0)
