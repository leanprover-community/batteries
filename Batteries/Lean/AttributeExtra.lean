`TagAttributeExtra` works around a limitation of `TagAttribute`, which is that definitions
must be tagged in the same file that declares the definition.
This works well for definitions in lean core, but for attributes declared outside the core
this is problematic because we may want to tag declarations created before the attribute
was defined.

To resolve this, we allow a one-time exception to the rule that attributes must be applied
in the same file as the declaration: During the declaration of the attribute itself,
we can tag arbitrary other definitions, but once the attribute is declared we must tag things
in the same file as normal.

structure TagAttributeExtra where
  /-- The environment extension for the attribute. -/
  ext : PersistentEnvExtension Name Name NameSet
  /-- A list of "base" declarations which have been pre-tagged. -/
  base : NameHashSet
  deriving Inhabited

/--
Registers a new tag attribute. The `extra` field is a list of definitions from other modules
which will be "pre-tagged" and are not subject to the usual restriction on tagging in the same
file as the declaration.

Note: The `extra` fields bypass the `validate` function -
we assume the builtins are also pre-validated.
