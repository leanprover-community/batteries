# We set up deprecations for identifiers formerly in the `Std` namespace.

Note that we have not moved anything in the `Std.CodeAction` or `Std.Linter` namespace.

These deprecations do not cover `Std.Tactic`, the contents of which has been moved,
but it would be much harder to generate the deprecations.
Let's hope that people using the tactic implementations can work this out themselves.
