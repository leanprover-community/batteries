# Once-per-file cache for tactics

This file defines cache data structures for tactics
that are initialized the first time they are accessed.
Since Lean 4 starts one process per file, these caches are once-per-file
and can for example be used to cache information about the imported modules.

The `Cache α` data structure is the most generic version we define.
It is created using `Cache.mk f` where `f : MetaM α` performs the initialization of the cache:
```
initialize numberOfImports : Cache Nat ← Cache.mk do
  (← getEnv).imports.size

-- (does not work in the same module where the cache is defined)
#eval show MetaM Nat from numberOfImports.get
```

The `DeclCache α` data structure computes a fold over the environment's constants:
`DeclCache.mk empty f` constructs such a cache
where `empty : α` and `f : Name → ConstantInfo → α → MetaM α`.
The result of the constants in the imports is cached between tactic invocations,
while for constants defined in the same file `f` is evaluated again every time.
This kind of cache can be used e.g. to populate discrimination trees.

Creates a `DeclCache`.

First, if `pre` is nonempty, run that for a value,
and if successful populate the cache with that value.

If `pre` is empty, or it fails,
the cached structure `α` is initialized with `empty`,
and then `addLibraryDecl` is called for every imported constant.
After all imported constants have been added, we run `post`.
Finally, the result is cached.

When `get` is called, `addDecl` is also called for every constant in the current file.

A type synonym for a `DeclCache` containing a pair of discrimination trees.
The first will store declarations in the current file,

Get matches from both the discrimination tree for declarations in the current file,
and for the imports.

Note that if you are calling this multiple times with the same environment,
it will rebuild the discrimination tree for the current file multiple times,
and it would be more efficient to call `c.get` once,
and then call `DiscrTree.getMatch` multiple times.

  -- Hence we reverse this list, so we try out more specific lemmas earlier.
