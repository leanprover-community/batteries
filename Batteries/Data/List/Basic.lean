Computes the "bag intersection" of `l₁` and `l₂`, that is,
the collection of elements of `l₁` which are also in `l₂`. As each element
is identified, it is removed from `l₂`, so elements are counted with multiplicity.

Constructs the union of two lists, by inserting the elements of `l₁` in reverse order to `l₂`.
As a result, `l₂` will always be a suffix, but only the last occurrence of each element in `l₁`
will be retained (but order will otherwise be preserved).

`List.mapWithComplement f l` is a variant of `List.mapWithPrefixSuffix`
that maps `f` across a list `l`.
For each `a ∈ l` with `l = pref ++ [a] ++ suff`, `a` is mapped to `f a (pref ++ suff)`,
i.e., the list input to `f` is `l` with `a` removed.
Example: if `f : Nat → list Nat → β`, `List.mapWithComplement f [1, 2, 3]` will produce the list
`[f 1 [2, 3], f 2 [1, 3], f 3 [1, 2]]`.

`Subperm l₁ l₂`, denoted `l₁ <+~ l₂`, means that `l₁` is a sublist of
a permutation of `l₂`. This is an analogue of `l₁ ⊆ l₂` which respects
multiplicities of elements, and is used for the `≤` relation on multisets.

`O(|l₁| * (|l₁| + |l₂|))`. Computes whether `l₁` is a sublist of a permutation of `l₂`.

`O(|l|)`. Inserts `a` in `l` right before the first element such that `p` is true, or at the end of
the list if `p` always false on `l`.

Note that this is an inefficient implementation, and if computation time is a concern you should be
