We add some n-ary versions of `List.zipWith` for functions with more than two arguments.
These can also be written in terms of `List.zip` or `List.zipWith`.
For example, `zipWith₃ f xs ys zs` could also be written as
`zipWith id (zipWith f xs ys) zs`
or as
`(zip xs <| zip ys zs).map fun ⟨x, y, z⟩ => f x y z`.

`List.mapWithPrefixSuffix f l` maps `f` across a list `l`.
For each `a ∈ l` with `l = pref ++ [a] ++ suff`, `a` is mapped to `f pref a suff`.
Example: if `f : list Nat → Nat → list Nat → β`,
`List.mapWithPrefixSuffix f [1, 2, 3]` will produce the list
`[f [] 1 [2, 3], f [1] 2 [3], f [1, 2] 3 []]`.

`List.mapWithComplement f l` is a variant of `List.mapWithPrefixSuffix`
that maps `f` across a list `l`.
For each `a ∈ l` with `l = pref ++ [a] ++ suff`, `a` is mapped to `f a (pref ++ suff)`,
i.e., the list input to `f` is `l` with `a` removed.
Example: if `f : Nat → list Nat → β`, `List.mapWithComplement f [1, 2, 3]` will produce the list
`[f 1 [2, 3], f 2 [1, 3], f 3 [1, 2]]`.

`Subperm l₁ l₂`, denoted `l₁ <+~ l₂`, means that `l₁` is a sublist of
a permutation of `l₂`. This is an analogue of `l₁ ⊆ l₂` which respects
multiplicities of elements, and is used for the `≤` relation on multisets.
