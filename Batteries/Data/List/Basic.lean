Computes the "bag intersection" of `l₁` and `l₂`, that is,
the collection of elements of `l₁` which are also in `l₂`. As each element
is identified, it is removed from `l₂`, so elements are counted with multiplicity.

Constructs the union of two lists, by inserting the elements of `l₁` in reverse order to `l₂`.
As a result, `l₂` will always be a suffix, but only the last occurrence of each element in `l₁`
will be retained (but order will otherwise be preserved).

Map each element of a `List` to an action, evaluate these actions in order,
and collect the results.

`Subperm l₁ l₂`, denoted `l₁ <+~ l₂`, means that `l₁` is a sublist of
a permutation of `l₂`. This is an analogue of `l₁ ⊆ l₂` which respects
multiplicities of elements, and is used for the `≤` relation on multisets.

/--
`O(|l₁| * (|l₁| + |l₂|))`. Computes whether `l₁` is a sublist of a permutation of `l₂`.
See `isSubperm_iff` for a characterization in terms of `List.Subperm`.

def isSubperm [BEq α] (l₁ l₂ : List α) : Bool := ∀ x ∈ l₁, count x l₁ ≤ count x l₂

/--
`O(|l|)`. Inserts `a` in `l` right before the first element such that `p` is true, or at the end of
the list if `p` always false on `l`.

`some r` if `l = p' ++ r` for some `p'` which is paiwise `==` to `p`,
and `none` otherwise. -/

`some r` if `l = r ++ s'` for some `s'` which is paiwise `==` to `s`,
and `none` otherwise. -/
def dropSuffix? [BEq α] (l s : List α) : Option (List α) :=
  let (r, s') := l.splitAt (l.length - s.length)
  if s' == s then some r else none

/-- `dropInfix? l i` returns
`some (p, s)` if `l = p ++ i' ++ s` for some `i'` which is paiwise `==` to `i`,
and `none` otherwise.

Note that this is an inefficient implementation, and if computation time is a concern you should be
using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm as implemented in `Batteries.Data.List.Matcher`.
